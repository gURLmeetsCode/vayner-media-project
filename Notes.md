Bugs:

1) Style inheritance from drop. Styling fails when more than one element is added to the same row.
    Ideas:
    Add style dynamically with addClass(). Unsure because various divs needs the property added.    
    Destructively remove styling with removeAttr() or .css(). Working to figure out how these methods can work.

Challenges:

1) Working to come up with logic to update userId from drop.

  Ideas:
  Change target div id to corresponding userId number.
  Use number to conditional logic in AJAX request to check and update table accordingly.
